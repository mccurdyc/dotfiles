# dotfiles

I stole a lot from @jessfraz's [dotfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles), so checkwe her's out too!

## Getting Started
`make`

Please, whatever you do, do not just blindly copy and paste ANYONE's dotfiles, it will cause more harm than benefit and you will spend hours debugging! Take small bits at a time and make sure you understand what you are taking.

## Bugs or Praise
If you find these files useful or find a bug, please let me know.

I'm @McCurdyColton on Twitter, but also feel free to open an issue here!
