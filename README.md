# dotfiles

I stole a lot from @jessfraz's [dotfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles), so check her's out too!

## Getting Started
```
make
```

Please, whatever you do, do not just blindly copy and paste ANYONE's dotfiles, it will cause more harm than benefit and you will spend hours debugging! Take small bits at a time and make sure you understand what you are taking.

## Todo
+ fix prompt to display branch
+ remove the MacOS-specific files (do checks instead)
