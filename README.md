## Getting Started
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/mccurdyc/dotfiles.git
$ git submodule update --init
$ make run
```

Please, whatever you do, do not just blindly copy and paste ANYONE's dotfiles, it will cause more harm than benefit and you will spend hours debugging! Take small bits at a time and make sure you understand what you are taking.
